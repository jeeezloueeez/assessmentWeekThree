        <h2>Welcome to my profile page!</h2>
        <p>You may have guessed it by now but I'm a software engineer. I'm pretty good at what I do. Oh, you want me to name some skills? Well...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm a master at html</li>
          <li>I dream in JavaScript</li>
          <li>I make a great horse for my little girl</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So the last skill there has nothing to do with engineering, but still a great skill to have.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>You may be thinking that this dude is just a nerd who sits on his computer all day...well...you'd be absolutely right!</p>
        <p>I love my technology! I think it is fascinating! The many things that one can do with it is incredible, but you don't need me to remind you, you're literally looking at a webpage on your own piece of tech!</p>
        <p>Apart from technology though, my interests include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing basketball</li>
          <li>Video production</li>
          <li>Comedy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Before this course at Devmountain, I was a full-time Video Production Manager. I have been doing video production since freshman year of high school. It was a real passion, but after 10 years of doing it full-time, it was starting to feel more like a burden than a passion.</p>
        <p>I was getting tired of it and the passion flame was getting dim, that is when I knew I needed to seek my next challenge! I wanted to bring back some exitement into my life and so I started to attempt designing webpages.</p>
        <p>I failed so hard, but the cool thing was that I didn't feel discouraged. I was excited! I was losing track of time just watching YouTube tutorials and following each step. I knew that this was going to be my new challenge and so here I am.</p>
        <p>You may be asking, "What is your end goal, Luis?"</p>
        <p>My end goal is to have a good recession proof profession where I can earn enough money to retire my wife and support my family comfortably. I believe that this goal is 100% possible in this new field I am trying to master. Wish me luck!</p>
